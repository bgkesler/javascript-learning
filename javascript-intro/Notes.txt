NOTES:
- Single and Double quotes are the same thing, project will set standard, IOLA uses single quotes 
- Semicolon at end of line is not necessary, but it is a good practice
- Variable can store any type of value, keyword var
    - var firstName = "myName";
    - var age = 20;
    - var isStudent = false;
    - var balance = 100.32;
    - var dob = new Date(2000, 0, 30); //Jan 30th 2000
